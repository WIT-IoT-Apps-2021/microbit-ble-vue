# micro:bit BLE Vue

A Vue.JS web app that communicates with a [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API).

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

**Note:** I would recommend using something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get an easy HTTPS endpoint.
